## üö® CRITICAL FINDINGS

### PR #10 Has Show-Stopping Bugs

**Issue:** The thinking budget implementation sends **wrong field names** to the API, causing it to be silently ignored.

**What's sent:**
```json
{"thinkingConfig": {"thinking_budget": 0}}
```

**What API expects:**
```json
{"thinkingConfig": {"thinkingBudget": 0}}
```

**Impact:** Users still get charged for thinking tokens even when setting budget to 0.

**Recommendation:** üî¥ **REJECT PR #10** - Request major revisions with bug fixes and tests.

## Recommended PR #10 Comment

```markdown
Thanks for the contribution! However, after reviewing against the official Gemini API
documentation, I've discovered a critical bug that prevents this from working.

**Critical Issue:**
The code sends `thinking_budget` but the API expects `thinkingBudget` (camelCase).
This causes the API to silently ignore the configuration, which explains why you still
saw thinking tokens being charged.

**Required Changes:**
1. Fix field name conversion: `thinking_budget` ‚Üí `thinkingBudget`
2. Add `include_thoughts` ‚Üí `includeThoughts` support
3. Add validation for budget ranges (0-24576 for Flash, 128-32768 for Pro)
4. Add comprehensive tests with HTTP mock verification
5. Add live API test verifying token reduction

I've documented the complete fix in [docs/issues/ISSUE_ANALYSIS.md].

Would you like to update the PR, or would you prefer if I take this over?
