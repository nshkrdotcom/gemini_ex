- `pr-10.json` - Pull request for thinking budget (has critical bugs)

## üö® Critical Findings

### PR #10 Contains Show-Stopping Bugs

**Discovered:** 2025-10-07 via official API documentation verification

The thinking budget implementation in PR #10 sends incorrect field names to the Gemini API:

- **Sends:** `{"thinkingConfig": {"thinking_budget": 0}}`
- **API Expects:** `{"thinkingConfig": {"thinkingBudget": 0}}`

**Impact:** API silently ignores the configuration, causing users to still be charged for thinking tokens.

**Recommendation:** Reject PR #10 and request major revisions.

## üîß Analysis Methodology

This analysis was conducted using the following process:

1. **Issue Collection:** Downloaded all active issues using `gh` CLI
2. **Code Review:** Examined relevant source code and PR changes
3. **API Verification:** Fetched and analyzed official Google Gemini API documentation
4. **Bug Discovery:** Compared implementation against official API specifications
5. **Solution Design:** Proposed fixes with code examples and test requirements
6. **Documentation:** Created comprehensive analysis with actionable recommendations

- `lib/gemini/types/common/part.ex` - Content parts (issue #11)
- `lib/gemini/types/content.ex` - Content types (issue #11)

## üß™ Testing Gaps Identified

The analysis revealed several critical testing gaps:

1. **Multimodal Content:** No tests for image/text mixed input
2. **Thinking Config:** No tests verifying API request format
3. **HTTP Mocking:** No verification of exact API payload
4. **Live API Tests:** Limited coverage for new features

**Recommended:** Add ~15 new test cases across multimodal and thinking config features.

## üìà Impact Assessment

### User Impact

- **Issue #11:** Blocks all multimodal usage - HIGH impact
- **PR #10:** Users think feature works but still get charged - HIGH impact
- **Issue #7:** Already resolved - NO impact

### Code Quality Impact

- Lack of tests allowed bugs to reach PR stage
- Documentation-code mismatch causing user confusion
- Field naming inconsistencies between Elixir and JSON

### Recommendations

1. Require tests for all new features (enforce in PR template)
2. Verify implementations against official API documentation
3. Add HTTP request verification to test suite
4. Improve documentation with actual working examples
