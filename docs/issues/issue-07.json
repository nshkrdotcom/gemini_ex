Overview\n\nThis document outlines the design for adding Tool Calling functionality to the `gemini_ex` Elixir library. The primary goals are:\n\n1.  **Achieve Parity:** Implement a tool definition and execution flow that aligns with the official Google `genai` Python SDK, as requested in the issue.\n2.  **Seamless Integration:** Provide a bridge to integrate with `snakepit`'s tool registry, allowing `gemini_ex` to use tools defined in remote Python workers.\n3.  **Extensibility:** Create a foundation that can support various tool types (Function Calling, Google Search, etc.) and is maintainable.\n\nThe design is split into two main parts: core feature implementation within `gemini_ex` and the integration layer for `snakepit`.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Core `gemini_ex` Feature Design\n\nThis section details the necessary changes within the `gemini_ex` library to support tool calling natively.\n\n##### 2.1. New Data Structures\n\nTo represent tools and their components in a structured way, a new module `Gemini.Types.Tooling` will be created. It will contain the following structs:\n\n**`lib/gemini/types/tooling.ex` (New File)**\n\n```elixir\ndefmodule Gemini.Types.Tooling do\n  @moduledoc \"Structs for Gemini tool definitions and calls.\"\n  \n  alias __MODULE__.{FunctionDeclaration, GoogleSearch, Schema, FunctionCall, FunctionResponse}\n\n  defmodule Tool do\n    @moduledoc \"A collection of tools that the model can use.\"\n    use TypedStruct\n\n    typedstruct do\n      field :function_declarations, [FunctionDeclaration.t()], default: []\n      field :google_search, GoogleSearch.t() | nil, default: nil\n      # Other tool types like Retrieval can be added here later.\n    end\n  end\n\n  defmodule GoogleSearch do\n    @moduledoc \"A tool that executes a Google search.\"\n    use TypedStruct\n    typedstruct do\n      # This struct is a marker and has no fields, matching the Python SDK.\n    end\n  end\n\n  defmodule Schema do\n    @moduledoc \"Represents a subset of the OpenAPI 3.0 schema object.\"\n    use TypedStruct\n\n    typedstruct do\n      field :type, atom(), enforce: true # :OBJECT, :STRING, :NUMBER, :INTEGER, :BOOLEAN, :ARRAY\n      field :description, String.t() | nil, default: nil\n      field :format, String.t() | nil, default: nil\n      field :enum, [String.t()] | nil, default: nil\n      field :properties, %{String.t() => __MODULE__.t()} | nil, default: nil\n      field :required, [String.t()] | nil, default: nil\n      field :items, __MODULE__.t() | nil, default: nil\n    end\n  end\n\n  defmodule FunctionDeclaration do\n    @moduledoc \"Structured representation of a function declaration.\"\n    use TypedStruct\n\n    typedstruct do\n      field :name, String.t(), enforce: true\n      field :description, String.t(), enforce: true\n      field :parameters, Schema.t() | nil, default: nil\n    end\n  end\n\n  defmodule FunctionCall do\n    @moduledoc \"A function call predicted by the model.\"\n    use TypedStruct\n    typedstruct do\n      field :name, String.t(), enforce: true\n      field :args, map(), default: %{}\n    end\n  end\n\n  defmodule FunctionResponse do\n    @moduledoc \"The result of a function call.\"\n    use TypedStruct\n    typedstruct do\n      field :name, String.t(), enforce: true\n      field :response, map(), enforce: true\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n\n##### 2.2. `Part` Struct Modification\n\nThe `Gemini.Types.Part` struct must be extended to carry tool-related content.\n\n**`lib/gemini/types/common/part.ex` (Modified)**\n\n```elixir\ndefmodule Gemini.Types.Part do\n  # ... existing code ...\n  alias Gemini.Types.Tooling.{FunctionCall, FunctionResponse}\n\n  typedstruct do\n    field(:text, String.t() | nil, default: nil)\n    field(:inline_data, Gemini.Types.Blob.t() | nil, default: nil)\n    # New fields for tool calls and responses\n    field(:function_call, FunctionCall.t() | nil, default: nil)\n    field(:function_response, FunctionResponse.t() | nil, default: nil)\n  end\n\n  # ... existing functions ...\n\n  @doc \"Create a function call part.\"\n  @spec function_call(String.t(), map()) :: t()\n  def function_call(name, args) do\n    %__MODULE__{function_call: %FunctionCall{name: name, args: args}}\n  end\n\n  @doc \"Create a function response part.\"\n  @spec function_response(String.t(), map()) :: t()\n  def function_response(name, response) do\n    %__MODULE__{function_response: %FunctionResponse{name: name, response: response}}\n  end\nend\n```\n\n##### 2.3. Request Generation\n\nThe `generateContent` request payload needs to include the `tools` field. This will be handled by updating `Gemini.Types.Request.GenerateContentRequest` and the `Gemini.Generate` module.\n\n**`lib/gemini/types/request/generate_content_request.ex` (Modified)**\n\n```elixir\ndefmodule Gemini.Types.Request.GenerateContentRequest do\n  # ... existing code ...\n  alias Gemini.Types.Tooling.Tool\n\n  typedstruct do\n    # ... existing fields ...\n    field(:tools, [Tool.t()], default: []) # Add new field\n    # ... existing fields ...\n  end\n  # ... to_json_map/1 will automatically handle the new field.\nend\n```\n\n**`lib/gemini/apis/generate.ex` (Modified)**\n\nThe `build_generate_request/2` function will now automatically accept and process a `:tools` option.\n\n```elixir\n# No change is needed here if GenerateContentRequest is updated correctly.\n# The call will look like this:\nGemini.Generate.content(\"What's the weather in Boston?\",\n  tools: [\n    %Gemini.Types.Tooling.Tool{\n      function_declarations: [%Gemini.Types.Tooling.FunctionDeclaration{...}]\n    }\n  ]\n)\n```\n\nThe `Coordinator` module will also need to be updated to convert the `Tool` structs to the camelCase map format required by the API.\n\n##### 2.4. Response Handling\n\nThe response parsing logic must be updated to recognize and handle `functionCall` parts from the API.\n\n**`lib/gemini/apis/generate.ex` (Modified `parse_content` helper)**\n\n```elixir\ndefp parse_content(content_data) do\n  parts =\n    content_data\n    |> Map.get(\"parts\", [])\n    |> Enum.map(fn part_data ->\n      cond do\n        Map.has_key?(part_data, \"text\") ->\n          Part.text(Map.get(part_data, \"text\"))\n\n        Map.has_key?(part_data, \"inlineData\") ->\n          # ... existing inlineData logic ...\n\n        # New clause for function calls\n        Map.has_key?(part_data, \"functionCall\") ->\n          call_data = Map.get(part_data, \"functionCall\")\n          Part.function_call(Map.get(call_data, \"name\"), Map.get(call_data, \"args\"))\n\n        true ->\n          # Fallback\n          Part.text(\"\")\n      end\n    end)\n  # ... rest of the function ...\nend\n```\n\n---\n\n#### 3. Snakepit Tool Bridge Integration\n\nTo bridge the gap between `gemini_ex` and `snakepit`, a new integration module will be created. This allows tools registered in `snakepit` (potentially from Python workers) to be seamlessly passed to the Gemini API.\n\n##### 3.1. New Module: `Gemini.ToolBridge`\n\nThis module will contain functions for converting between `snakepit` tool specifications and `gemini_ex` tool structs.\n\n**`lib/gemini/tool_bridge.ex` (New File)**\n\n```elixir\ndefmodule Gemini.ToolBridge do\n  @moduledoc \"Provides integration between gemini_ex tools and the snakepit tool bridge.\"\n\n  alias Gemini.Types.Tooling.{Tool, FunctionDeclaration, Schema}\n  alias Snakepit.Bridge.ToolRegistry\n\n  @doc \"\"\"\n  Fetches all tools from a snakepit session and converts them for Gemini.\n  \"\"\"\n  @spec get_tools_for_gemini(String.t()) :: {:ok, [Tool.t()]} | {:error, any}\n  def get_tools_for_gemini(session_id) do\n    tools =\n      session_id\n      |> ToolRegistry.list_tools()\n      |> Enum.map(&from_snakepit_tool/1)\n\n    {:ok, tools}\n  end\n\n  @doc \"\"\"\n  Converts a Snakepit tool specification into a Gemini Tool struct.\n  \"\"\"\n  def from_snakepit_tool(%Snakepit.Bridge.InternalToolSpec{} = spec) do\n    gemini_schema = convert_params_to_schema(spec.parameters)\n\n    func_decl = %FunctionDeclaration{\n      name: spec.name,\n      description: spec.description,\n      parameters: gemini_schema\n    }\n\n    %Tool{function_declarations: [func_decl]}\n  end\n\n  defp convert_params_to_schema(params) when is_list(params) do\n    properties =\n      Map.new(params, fn p ->\n        # Convert snakepit param type to Gemini schema type\n        schema_type_atom = String.to_atom(p.type)\n        prop_schema = %Schema{type: schema_type_atom, description: p.description}\n        {p.name, prop_schema}\n      end)\n\n    required =\n      params\n      |> Enum.filter(& &1.required)\n      |> Enum.map(& &1.name)\n\n    %Schema{\n      type: :OBJECT,\n      properties: properties,\n      required: required\n    }\n  end\nend\n```\n\n##### 3.2. Example Workflow\n\nHere is the end-to-end workflow leveraging this integration:\n\n1.  **Tool Definition (Python):** A developer defines a function in a Python worker.\n    ```python\n    # In a snakepit python worker\n    def get_current_weather(location: str, unit: str = \"celsius\"):\n        \"\"\"Gets the current weather for a given location.\"\"\"\n        # ... implementation ...\n    ```\n\n2.  **Tool Registration (`snakepit`):** On startup, the `snakepit` Python worker inspects the function and registers it with the `ToolRegistry` on the Elixir side.\n\n3.  **Tool Conversion (`gemini_ex`):** The Elixir application fetches and converts the registered tools.\n    ```elixir\n    session_id = \"user_123\"\n    {:ok, gemini_tools} = Gemini.ToolBridge.get_tools_for_gemini(session_id)\n    ```\n\n4.  **API Call (`gemini_ex`):** The application makes a call to Gemini, providing the converted tools.\n    ```elixir\n    prompt = \"What's the weather like in Boston?\"\n    {:ok, response} = Gemini.generate(prompt, tools: gemini_tools)\n    ```\n\n5.  **Model Response:** Gemini responds with a `function_call` part.\n    ```elixir\n    # response.candidates |> List.first() |> Map.get(:content) |> Map.get(:parts)\n    [\n      %Gemini.Types.Part{\n        function_call: %Gemini.Types.Tooling.FunctionCall{\n          name: \"get_current_weather\",\n          args: %{\"location\" => \"Boston, MA\"}\n        },\n        ...\n      }\n    ]\n    ```\n\n6.  **Tool Execution (`snakepit`):** The application uses `snakepit` to execute the requested function on the Python worker.\n    ```elixir\n    %Gemini.Types.Part{function_call: call} = function_call_part\n    {:ok, result} = Snakepit.execute_in_session(session_id, call.name, call.args)\n    # result -> %{\"temperature\" => \"22\", \"unit\" => \"celsius\", \"forecast\" => \"windy\"}\n    ```\n\n7.  **Follow-up API Call:** The application sends the tool's result back to Gemini to get a final, human-readable answer.\n    ```elixir\n    # Create conversation history with the function call and response\n    history = [\n      Content.text(prompt, \"user\"),\n      Content.new(role: \"model\", parts: [function_call_part]),\n      Content.new(role: \"user\", parts: [Part.function_response(call.name, %{result: result})])\n    ]\n    {:ok, final_response} = Gemini.generate(history)\n    # final_response.text -> \"The current weather in Boston is 22Â°C and windy.\"\n    ```\n\n---\n\n#### 4. Implementation Plan\n\nThe implementation will involve the following file changes:\n\n1.  **Create `lib/gemini/types/tooling.ex`:** Define the new data structures for tools.\n2.  **Create `lib/gemini/tool_bridge.ex`:** Implement the conversion logic for `snakepit` integration.\n3.  **Modify `lib/gemini/types/common/part.ex`:** Add `function_call` and `function_response` fields and helper functions.\n4.  **Modify `lib/gemini/types/request/generate_content_request.ex`:** Add the `:tools` field to the request struct.\n5.  **Modify `lib/gemini/apis/generate.ex`:** Update the response parsing logic to handle `functionCall` parts.\n6.  **Modify `lib/gemini/apis/coordinator.ex`:** Ensure the `tools` option is correctly passed through and serialized into the API request map with camelCase keys.","createdAt":"2025-08-04T04:59:55Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/nshkrdotcom/gemini_ex/issues/7#issuecomment-3149131868","viewerDidAuthor":true},{"id":"IC_kwDOO3f1O867tAfd","author":{"login":"nshkrdotcom"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"### **Contextual File List for `gemini_ex` Tool Implementation**\n\n#### A. Google `genai` Python SDK Files\n\nThese files serve as the \"source of truth\" for the API design, defining the data structures and method signatures that `gemini_ex` should aim to replicate for a consistent developer experience.\n\n1.  **`types.py`**:\n    *   **Reason for Inclusion**: This is the most critical file. It defines the Pydantic models for `Tool`, `FunctionDeclaration`, `Schema`, `FunctionCall`, `GenerateContentResponse`, `Candidate`, and `Part`. The new Elixir structs in `Gemini.Types.Tooling` are designed to be direct equivalents of these Python classes.\n\n2.  **`models.py`**:\n    *   **Reason for Inclusion**: Contains the primary `generate_content` and `generate_content_stream` methods. This file shows how the `tools` and `tool_config` parameters are used in practice, how responses containing function calls are handled, and the logic for automatic function calling loops. It provides the behavioral context for the entire feature.\n\n3.  **`_automatic_function_calling_util.py`**:\n    *   **Reason for Inclusion**: This utility contains the logic for inspecting Python functions and converting them into `FunctionDeclaration` schemas. This is the direct Python equivalent of what the `Gemini.ToolBridge` needs to do when converting a `snakepit` tool spec, making it an invaluable reference.\n\n4.  **`_transformers.py`**:\n    *   **Reason for Inclusion**: Contains the `t_tool` transformer function, which processes user-provided tool definitions into the format required by the API. This provides context on how different forms of tool definitions (e.g., callables, dicts) are normalized before being sent in a request.\n\n5.  **`chats.py`**:\n    *   **Reason for Inclusion**: Demonstrates how tool calls and function responses are managed within a multi-turn conversation. The design document includes a multi-turn example, and this file shows the canonical implementation of that state management.\n\n#### B. `snakepit/lib` Elixir Library Files\n\nThese files define the Elixir-side of the `snakepit` bridge, which is the target for our integration. They provide the necessary context for the `Gemini.ToolBridge` to correctly interact with `snakepit`'s tool management system.\n\n1.  **`snakepit/bridge/tool_registry.ex`**:\n    *   **Reason for Inclusion**: This is the core integration point. It defines the `Snakepit.Bridge.InternalToolSpec` struct that `Gemini.ToolBridge` must convert. It also contains the GenServer API (`list_tools`, `execute_local_tool`) that the full tool execution loop will interact with.\n\n2.  **`snakepit/bridge/session.ex`**:\n    *   **Reason for Inclusion**: Defines the `Session` struct. Since tools in `snakepit` are session-scoped, understanding the session data structure is crucial for implementing a robust integration that correctly handles session state.\n\n3.  **`snakepit/bridge/session_store.ex`**:\n    *   **Reason for Inclusion**: Provides the public API for managing sessions. The tool execution loop will need to interact with this to fetch session information and potentially store program/tool state.\n\n4.  **`snakepit/grpc/bridge_server.ex`**:\n    *   **Reason for Inclusion**: This is the Elixir gRPC server implementation. It shows how Python workers register their tools via the `RegisterTools` RPC. This provides the context for how the `ToolRegistry` is populated from remote workers.\n\n5.  **`snakepit/grpc/generated/snakepit_bridge.pb.ex`**:\n    *   **Reason for Inclusion**: The generated Protobuf code for Elixir. It defines the exact `ToolSpec` and `ParameterSpec` messages that are sent from Python. This is the raw data that the bridge server receives and converts into the `InternalToolSpec`.\n\n6.  **`snakepit.ex`**:\n    *   **Reason for Inclusion**: The main public API for `snakepit`. It contains the `execute_in_session` function, which is the primary function used in the design's example workflow to execute a tool on a Python worker.\n\n#### C. `snakepit/priv` Python and Protocol Files\n\nThese files show how the Python side of the `snakepit` bridge defines, discovers, and registers its tools. This is the counterpart to the Elixir logic and completes the end-to-end picture.\n\n1.  **`proto/snakepit_bridge.proto`**:\n    *   **Reason for Inclusion**: The Protobuf definition file is the canonical contract for the entire gRPC bridge. It defines the `ToolRegistration` message that Python sends and the `BridgeService` RPCs that facilitate communication.\n\n2.  **`python/snakepit_bridge/base_adapter.py`**:\n    *   **Reason for Inclusion**: This is the most important Python file for context. It defines the `BaseAdapter` class, the `@tool` decorator, and the `get_tools` method which discovers Python functions and converts them into `ToolRegistration` Protobuf messages. This is the direct source of the data that `Gemini.ToolBridge` will be consuming.\n\n3.  **`python/grpc_server.py`**:\n    *   **Reason for Inclusion**: The Python gRPC server implementation. It shows how the server receives calls from Elixir and dispatches them to the adapter's `execute_tool` method. It also shows the `RegisterTools` implementation on the Python side, completing the registration workflow.\n\n4.  **`python/snakepit_bridge/session_context.py`**:\n    *   **Reason for Inclusion**: Provides a powerful example of the bridge's capabilities, showing how a Python worker can maintain a stateful context that calls back into Elixir to manage variables and even execute Elixir-defined tools. This demonstrates the bidirectional nature of the bridge.\n\n5.  **`python/snakepit_bridge/adapters/showcase/showcase_adapter.py`**:\n    *   **Reason for Inclusion**: A concrete example of an adapter implementation. It shows how various Python functions (with different signatures and purposes) are exposed as tools, providing a practical reference for how `snakepit` tools look in the wild.","createdAt":"2025-08-04T05:04:13Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/nshkrdotcom/gemini_ex/issues/7#issuecomment-3149137885","viewerDidAuthor":true},{"id":"IC_kwDOO3f1O867uFDb","author":{"login":"nshkrdotcom"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"As a result of this issue from @yasoob, I came up with the idea for `ALTAR`, the Agent & Tool Arbitration Protocol:\n\nA comprehensive, language-agnostic, and transport-agnostic protocol designed to enable secure, observable, and stateful interoperability between autonomous agents, AI models, and traditional software systems.\n\nhttps://github.com/nshkrdotcom/ALTAR","createdAt":"2025-08-04T07:18:28Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/nshkrdotcom/gemini_ex/issues/7#issuecomment-3149418715","viewerDidAuthor":true},{"id":"IC_kwDOO3f1O868LfHD","author":{"login":"nshkrdotcom"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"In this response from Gemini, I'm exploring three ways to build a generalized local tool call mechanism that will seamlessly work with `ALTAR`. The final rec is to build `LATER`, Local Agent & Tool Execution Runtime:\n\n---\n\nExcellent question. This is a crucial architectural decision that strikes at the heart of the tension between developer experience for simple use cases and the robust, secure architecture required for enterprise systems. The goal is to allow a `gemini_ex` user to define a local Elixir function and have it \"just work\" as a tool, without the overhead of the full ALTAR Host/Runtime protocol, while still providing a clear path to that more advanced architecture.\n\nLet's critically evaluate the three proposed options.\n\n---\n\n### Analysis of Options\n\n#### Option 1: Revise the ALTAR Spec to Support Local Tools\n\nThis approach would involve modifying the ALTAR protocol to include a \"local\" or \"in-process\" mode, where the Host and Runtime are the same application.\n\n*   **How it would work:** The spec would need to define a special `runtime_id` (e.g., `@local`) and a simplified registration flow (`RegisterLocalTools`) that bypasses network transport and directly registers a function reference into the Host's `ToolRegistry`. The Host would then dispatch calls to this local `runtime_id` via a direct function call instead of a network RPC.\n\n*   **Pros:**\n    *   **Unified Standard:** Everything would, in theory, be governed by a single, comprehensive specification.\n    *   **Conceptual Simplicity:** There is only \"one thing to learn\": ALTAR.\n\n*   **Cons:**\n    *   **Dilutes Core Value:** The absolute strongest feature of ALTAR, as argued in `20250804_ALTAR_Protocol_Assessment.md`, is its **Host-centric security model**. The Host is the authority, and Runtimes must fulfill pre-approved contracts. Introducing a local mode fundamentally blurs this line. It creates a special case where a \"Runtime\" can define its own contract and execution logic within the Host's own process space, undermining the core security principle.\n    *   **Increases Complexity:** The spec would need to handle complex edge cases. What does `AnnounceRuntime` mean for a local tool? How is a `SecurityContext` enforced when the call never leaves the process? This adds significant complexity and potential for loopholes in the specification.\n    *   **Contradicts Vision:** The ALTAR spec is explicitly for *interoperability* between *distributed* components. Adding an in-process-only feature feels like a tacked-on appendage that doesn't align with the core vision.\n\n*   **Verdict:** **Poor Choice.** This option compromises ALTAR's most important featureâ€”its security modelâ€”for the sake of convenience. It makes the protocol more complex and less focused, ultimately weakening its value proposition for its primary target audience: the enterprise.\n\n---\n\n#### Option 2: Implement Local Tools Ad-Hoc in `gemini_ex`\n\nThis approach keeps ALTAR pure and implements local tool handling as a separate, internal feature of the `gemini_ex` library, completely independent of the ALTAR specification.\n\n*   **How it would work:** `gemini_ex` would have a `Gemini.Tools` module with a local, in-memory tool registry. A user could register an Elixir function with this local registry. The `Gemini.generate` function would have an internal loop: if the model returns a `functionCall`, it first checks the local registry. If found, it executes it. If not, it could then try to delegate to an ALTAR-aware system like `snakepit`.\n\n*   **Pros:**\n    *   **Preserves ALTAR Integrity:** The ALTAR spec remains focused on its distributed, high-security use case.\n    *   **Fast Implementation:** This is likely the quickest way to get the feature working inside `gemini_ex`.\n    *   **Simplicity:** For users who *only* need local tools, the implementation is straightforward.\n\n*   **Cons:**\n    *   **No \"Promotion Path\":** A tool defined for the ad-hoc local system would have no clear, standardized way to be \"promoted\" to a distributed ALTAR Runtime. The tool definition formats would likely differ.\n    *   **Architectural Debt:** The logic for dispatching between local and remote (ALTAR) tools becomes a complex, non-standardized piece of glue code within `gemini_ex`. This can become messy and hard to maintain.\n    *   **Missed Opportunity:** It fails to create a standardized \"contract\" for what a local tool looks like, leading to potential inconsistencies.\n\n*   **Verdict:** **Viable but Sub-optimal.** This is a pragmatic choice that gets the job done but lacks architectural elegance. It creates a hard-to-bridge divide between \"local tools\" and \"enterprise ALTAR tools,\" which feels like a missed opportunity for a cohesive ecosystem.\n\n---\n\n#### Option 3: Define a Complementary \"Local Tool\" Specification\n\nThis is the most nuanced and architecturally sound approach. It involves creating a second, much simpler specification designed *exclusively* for defining and executing local, in-process tools. This new spec would be a companion to ALTAR, not a replacement or modification.\n\nLet's call this new specification **LATER: Local Agent & Tool Execution Runtime**.\n\n*   **How it would work:**\n    1.  **LATER Specification:** A minimal spec is created. It defines:\n        *   A standard way to declare a function as a tool (e.g., using an Elixir macro like `deftool`).\n        *   A standard format for the tool's schema, derived via introspection (similar to `snakepit`'s Python decorator).\n        *   A standard, in-process `ToolRegistry` behavior.\n        *   A standard `ToolExecutor` behavior for invoking the registered tools.\n    2.  **`gemini_ex` Implements LATER:** `gemini_ex` would provide the canonical Elixir implementation of the LATER spec. Users could define tools directly in their Elixir code.\n    3.  **Unified Tool Coordination in `gemini_ex`:** The library would feature a `Gemini.Tooling.Coordinator` responsible for the automatic function calling loop. This coordinator would use a pluggable `ToolSource` behavior to find and execute tools.\n        *   One adapter, `Gemini.Tooling.LATER.ToolSource`, would look up tools in the local LATER registry.\n        *   Another adapter, `Gemini.Tooling.ALTAR.ToolSource`, would look up tools by communicating with an ALTAR Host (e.g., the `snakepit` bridge).\n\n*   **Pros:**\n    *   **Architectural Purity:** ALTAR is preserved as the gold standard for secure, distributed tool interoperability. LATER is established as the standard for simple, local, in-process tool execution. The separation of concerns is crystal clear.\n    *   **Excellent Developer Experience:** For local tools, the experience is seamless: `use Gemini.Tools; deftool my_function(...) do ... end`.\n    *   **Clear Promotion Path:** Because both LATER and ALTAR would use a compatible schema definition for tools (based on the Google `genai` standard), a tool defined locally with LATER could be moved into a separate ALTAR Runtime with minimal changes. The contract remains the same; only the execution environment changes.\n    *   **Pluggable and Extensible:** The `ToolSource` behavior in `gemini_ex` makes the system incredibly flexible. You could add sources for OpenAPI specs, gRPC services, or other tool providers in the future without changing the core generation logic.\n\n*   **Cons:**\n    *   **Two Specs to Maintain:** While LATER would be minimal, it's still another specification to document and manage.\n    *   **Slightly More Upfront Work:** This requires designing the `ToolSource` abstraction layer, which is more work than a simple ad-hoc implementation.\n\n*   **Verdict:** **Highly Recommended.** This is the superior long-term solution. It provides the best of both worlds: a simple, elegant developer experience for local tools and a clear, secure path toward the enterprise-grade capabilities of ALTAR. It creates a cohesive, well-architected ecosystem.\n\n---\n\n### Grand Unified Vision & Implementation Proposal (Based on Option 3)\n\nThis is how the pieces would fit together inside `gemini_ex`.\n\n**1. The `LATER` Implementation (`Gemini.Tools`)**\n\nA developer would define local tools like this:\n\n```elixir\n# lib/my_app/my_tools.ex\ndefmodule MyApp.MyTools do\n  use Gemini.Tools\n\n  @doc \"Gets the current weather for a given location.\"\n  deftool get_current_weather(location, unit \\\\ \"celsius\") do\n    # ... Elixir code to get weather ...\n    %{temperature: 22, unit: unit, forecast: \"windy\"}\n  end\nend\n```\n*   The `deftool` macro uses `Code.get_doc` and argument parsing to automatically generate a `Gemini.Types.Tooling.FunctionDeclaration` and register it with a local, in-process ETS-backed `LATER.Registry`.\n\n**2. The `Tooling.Coordinator` and `ToolSource` Behaviour**\n\nThis becomes the new heart of tool execution in `gemini_ex`.\n\n```elixir\n# lib/gemini/tooling/coordinator.ex (New)\ndefmodule Gemini.Tooling.Coordinator do\n  defmodule ToolSource do\n    @callback get_declarations(session_id :: String.t()) :: {:ok, [FunctionDeclaration.t()]}\n    @callback execute_tool(session_id :: String.t(), function_call :: FunctionCall.t()) :: {:ok, result :: map()} | {:error, term()}\n  end\n\n  # The main AFC loop lives here.\n  def execute_with_tools(prompt, opts) do\n    tool_sources = Keyword.get(opts, :tool_sources, [Gemini.Tooling.LATER.ToolSource]) # Default to local\n    # 1. Aggregate FunctionDeclarations from all sources.\n    # 2. Call Gemini.generate with the declarations.\n    # 3. If model returns a functionCall:\n    # 4. Iterate through sources to find one that can execute the tool.\n    # 5. Execute it and get the result.\n    # 6. Call Gemini.generate again with the FunctionResponse.\n    # 7. Return the final text response.\n  end\nend\n\n# lib/gemini/tooling/later_source.ex (New)\ndefmodule Gemini.Tooling.LATER.ToolSource do\n  @behaviour Gemini.Tooling.Coordinator.ToolSource\n  \n  def get_declarations(_session_id), do: LATER.Registry.list_declarations()\n  def execute_tool(_session_id, call), do: LATER.Executor.execute(call)\nend\n\n# lib/gemini/tooling/altar_source.ex (New - Replaces Gemini.ToolBridge)\ndefmodule Gemini.Tooling.ALTAR.ToolSource do\n  @behaviour Gemini.Tooling.Coordinator.ToolSource\n  alias Snakepit.Bridge.ToolRegistry\n\n  def get_declarations(session_id) do\n    # Logic from Gemini.ToolBridge to convert snakepit specs to FunctionDeclarations\n  end\n\n  def execute_tool(session_id, call) do\n    Snakepit.execute_in_session(session_id, call.name, call.args)\n  end\nend\n```\n\n**3. Unified Top-Level API in `Gemini`**\n\nThe main `Gemini` module would use the `Coordinator` to provide a simple, unified experience.\n\n```elixir\n# lib/gemini.ex (Modified)\ndefmodule Gemini do\n  @doc \"\"\"\n  Generates content with support for local and remote tools.\n\n  ## Options\n    ...\n    - `:tool_sources`: A list of modules implementing the `ToolSource` behaviour.\n      Defaults to `[Gemini.Tooling.LATER.ToolSource]` for local Elixir tools.\n      To use snakepit tools, pass `[Gemini.Tooling.ALTAR.ToolSource]`.\n  \"\"\"\n  def generate(contents, opts \\\\ []) do\n    # Check if tools are configured\n    if Keyword.has_key?(opts, :tool_sources) do\n      # Let the coordinator handle the full AFC loop\n      Gemini.Tooling.Coordinator.execute_with_tools(contents, opts)\n    else\n      # Standard generation without tools\n      Coordinator.generate_content(contents, opts)\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n\n### Final Recommendation\n\n**Adopt Option 3.**\n\nDefine the minimal **LATER** specification for local tools and implement it natively within `gemini_ex` using a `deftool` macro. Refactor the tool-handling logic around a central `Tooling.Coordinator` with a pluggable `ToolSource` behavior. This provides:\n1.  **The simple, \"just works\" local tool experience** the user wants.\n2.  **A clean, robust, and extensible architecture** for `gemini_ex`.\n3.  **Preservation of the ALTAR protocol's integrity** for its intended enterprise use case.\n4.  **A clear and logical path for tools to graduate** from local LATER execution to distributed ALTAR execution.","createdAt":"2025-08-06T01:34:33Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/nshkrdotcom/gemini_ex/issues/7#issuecomment-3157127619","viewerDidAuthor":true},{"id":"IC_kwDOO3f1O868wISb","author":{"login":"nshkrdotcom"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"@yasoob Per request, I've released v0.2.0 with tool calls:\n\nhttps://hexdocs.pm/gemini_ex/0.2.0/readme.html\n\nhttps://hexdocs.pm/gemini_ex/0.2.0/automatic_tool_execution.html\n\nI'd be stoked if you can try it out and see if it works!
