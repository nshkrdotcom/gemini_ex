and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **API Response Parsing**: Fixed issue where `usage_metadata` was always nil on successful `Gemini.generate/2` calls ([#3](https://github.com/nshkrdotcom/gemini_ex/issues/3))
  - The Gemini API returns camelCase keys like `"usageMetadata"` which were not being converted to snake_case atoms
  - Updated `atomize_key` function in coordinator to properly convert camelCase strings to snake_case atoms
  - Now properly populates `usage_metadata` with token count information

## [0.0.2] - 2025-06-09

### Fixed
- **Documentation Rendering**: Fixed mermaid diagram rendering errors on hex docs by removing emoji characters from diagram labels
- **Package Links**: Removed redundant "Documentation" link in hex package configuration, keeping only "Online documentation"
- **Configuration References**: Updated TELEMETRY_IMPLEMENTATION.md to reference `:gemini_ex` instead of `:gemini` for correct application configuration

### Changed
- Improved hex docs compatibility for better rendering of documentation diagrams
- Enhanced documentation consistency across all markdown files

## [0.0.1] - 2025-06-09
