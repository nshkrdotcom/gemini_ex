# Requirements Document

## Introduction

ALTAR (The Agent & Tool Arbitration Protocol) is a comprehensive, language-agnostic protocol designed to enable secure, observable, and stateful interoperability between autonomous agents, AI models, and traditional software systems. Building upon the foundation established by the `gemini_ex` Elixir client and the `snakepit` bidirectional tool bridge, ALTAR aims to become the industry standard for enterprise tool integration and agent orchestration.

The protocol addresses the critical need for a unified, transport-agnostic standard that allows different AI systems, programming languages, and runtime environments to seamlessly share tools and capabilities while maintaining security, observability, and state isolation.
