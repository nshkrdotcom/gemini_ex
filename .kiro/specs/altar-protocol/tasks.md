# Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan converts the ALTAR protocol design into a series of discrete, manageable coding tasks that build incrementally toward a complete, production-ready system. Each task is designed to be executable by a coding agent with clear objectives and specific requirements references.

The plan follows a test-driven development approach, prioritizing core functionality first, then building out advanced features. All tasks focus exclusively on code implementation, testing, and integration activities.
