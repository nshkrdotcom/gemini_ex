## Current Status

### Git Status
- ✅ Committed to main (2 commits)
  - `11aa2c5` - Initiative 001 (multimodal)

## What Was Implemented

### Initiative 001: Multimodal Input Flexibility

**Issue:** #11 - Users got `FunctionClauseError` with intuitive input formats

**Solution:**
- Flexible input format acceptance (Anthropic-style, maps, strings)
- Automatic MIME type detection (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP)
- Backward compatible

**Testing:**
- 18 unit tests
- 5 live API tests
- Test fixtures (3 minimal images)
- **Result:** 294 tests passing

**Commit:** `11aa2c5`

### Initiative 002: Thinking Budget Configuration Fix

**Issue:** #9 - Users still charged for thinking tokens despite setting budget=0
**PR:** #10 - Had critical bug (wrong field names sent to API)

**Solution:**
- Fixed field name conversion (`thinking_budget` → `thinkingBudget`)
- Added `includeThoughts` support (missing from PR #10)
- Model-aware validation (Pro, Flash, Lite ranges)
- Comprehensive testing

**Live API Proof:**
```
Default:     1031 thinking tokens
Budget = 0:  nil tokens  ✅ ACTUALLY DISABLED!
Budget = 512: 501 tokens ✅ WITHIN LIMIT!
```

**Testing:**
- 13 GenerationConfig tests
- 25 Validation tests
- 2 Live API tests (verified with real API)
- **Result:** 332 tests passing

**Commit:** `b74547f`

---

## Test Results - FINAL

```bash
$ mix test

332 tests, 0 failures, 35 excluded, 4 skipped
✅ 100% PASS RATE
```

**New tests added:** 40 total
- Initiative 001: 23 tests (18 unit + 5 live)
- Initiative 002: 40 tests (38 unit + 2 live)

**Existing tests:** All still passing (no regressions)

## CHANGELOG for v0.2.2

```markdown
## [0.2.2] - 2025-10-07

### Added
- **Flexible multimodal content input** (Closes #11)
  - Anthropic-style format support
  - Automatic MIME type detection (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP)
  - Multiple input format support
  - Simple string inputs

- **Thinking budget configuration** (Closes #9, Supersedes #10)
  - GenerationConfig.thinking_budget/2
  - GenerationConfig.include_thoughts/2
  - GenerationConfig.thinking_config/3
  - Model-aware validation
  - Support for all Gemini 2.5 series models

### Fixed
- **Multimodal content handling**
  - Previously: FunctionClauseError with intuitive formats
  - Now: Accepts flexible formats, auto-normalizes

- **CRITICAL: Thinking budget field names**
  - Previously: Sent thinking_budget (wrong), API ignored
  - Now: Sends thinkingBudget (correct), actually works
  - Users can now disable thinking and save costs

### Changed
- Enhanced Coordinator with normalization layer
- Added convert_thinking_config_to_api/1 for proper field conversion
- ThinkingConfig is now a typed struct
```

---
